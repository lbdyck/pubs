# Publications

These files are the publications/documentation for some of the tools found here.

These may, or may not, be current for the tool but they are the latest versions
of the doc that I have had time to do.

There should be a `.doc` or `.docx` for each set and then a `.pdf` along with in 
some cases and `.epub`.

If anyone wants to update any of these feel free and please then share your update
with me so others have the benefit.
